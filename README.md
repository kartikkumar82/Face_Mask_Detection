# Face Mask Detection Using CNN

A deep-learning based Face Mask Detection system built using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **TensorFlow/Keras**.  
The model classifies whether a person **is wearing a mask** or **not wearing a mask** using image data and real-time webcam feed.

---

##  Features
- Detects “Mask” and “No Mask” in images or live video
- Uses CNN architecture for high accuracy
- Image data preprocessing & augmentation
- Real-time detection using OpenCV
- Easy to deploy and extend

---

##  Tech Stack
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  

---


##  How It Works
1. Preprocess images (resize, normalize).  
2. Train a CNN model on two classes:  
   - **With Mask**  
   - **Without Mask**  
3. Evaluate model performance.  
4. Perform real-time mask detection using a webcam/video feed.

##  Model Performance
- Accuracy: **93%** (replace with your result)  
- Loss Curve & Accuracy Curve plotted

##  Future Improvements
- Deploy as a web app  
- Add multi-class mask types  
- Optimize model for mobile devices
